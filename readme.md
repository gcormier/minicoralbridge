The goal was to try and learn a bit more about PCI. 
This card allows me to use my mini PCI-express Google Coral card in a regular PCI Express 1x slot.

In theory it will work for any type of mPCIe card that only requires 3.3 volts and uses the PCI communication lanes and no other protocols (eg SMBus)

## Kits on Tindie
I did an order of enough PCB/parts for 10 boards. I'll put the leftover 8 boards and parts up on tindie for sale
